## Summary

League of Legends is a MOBA style game where the objective is to use teamwork and skill to destroy the enemies Nexus (Base). 
As in most MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) games the player would only control a single character as a part of a driving team effort throughout the map. 
Within the map there are 4 options/lanes for where the players could station themselves: Top, Mid, Bottom, and the region that takes up space between the lanes called Jungle. 
As the match continues, players engage in combat with one another using skills their chosen champion can use. Capturing towers and acquiring kills will help lead the team to victory, however extra objective like monster camps can slowly turn a game around in an instant.
What keeps player coming back to play this tactful game, is the large variety of champions/characters players can choose from. 
From tanks who need to soak up all the damage from the enemy team, to mages that can cast powerful spells, to deadly assassins who can jump into a fight and jump out without being targeted, there are champions for  any playstyle. 
With these champions, comes unique abilities and item that can go alongside their playstyles, or even off-meta item builds that can catch the opponent off guard. 
How does League of legends stay fresh though? That can be answered by its showcase of extensive in-game skins and cosmetics that all of the champions have to offer. 
All champions in the game (154) have at least 2 skins, with the more popular characters have up to 8 or 9. 
Being able to add a personal touch to the champion being played creates a dynamic where the player will be more willing to come back and play the game as they have invested their currency into it. 
With all the features League of Legends has to offer; selective playstyles, more than 100 playable characters, and unique skins to dress those characters, League of Legends is a good game to pick up if MOBA style games are in your sight.


## Final Thoughts

League of Legends is a game that I have a Love/Hate relationship with. While the 
matches can be very fun and different each time, occasionally the community can become toxic as teammates and opponents
are able to engage in slander whenever they would like. However, there are options 
to mute communications. Taking each match at a time and spacing out sessions would definitely be a good decision. Besides this, League of Legends has always gripped my attention with its fresh roster and gameplay system where strategy and teamwork are a must.
