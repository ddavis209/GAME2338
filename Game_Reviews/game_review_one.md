## Summary

YuGiOh! is a trading card game adapted from its anime predecessor where players use unique cards to battle till one person loses all their life points. Cards can range from monster, spell, or trap cards in the original version, while even stronger and more complex cards were soon adapted in the later seasons. Mechanically, players follow a sequence of phases within their turns. Those phases are: Standby Phase(SP), Main Phase 1(M1), Battle Phase(BP), Main Phase 2(M2), and End Phase(EP). After these phases are completed, the next player takes their turn and so forth until one player loses all of their life points.  
So, what can a player do during each phase? Usually, only certain cards can be played during SP, so it’s a phase that usually is passively glossed over. M1 is where most cards are played and active; cards can also be placed on the board face-down to be used later. BP is where all the action happens, this is where players can attack each other’s monsters in order to get an advantage on the field, or attack their opponent directly.  Some monsters can also activate their effects during this phase if determined by the card. However, players may be defensive during this phase as cards that are phase down can be used to counter an attack or effect. M2 is the same as M1, it is used to place down more cards and certain cards can only be activated at this phase. EP is the ending of a players turn, where again, certain cards can be activated at the last chance before switching sides. This may all seem like a lot of detail to consume, however with the current state of the game, these phases finish very quickly. 
This competitive game continues to be played as new cards and themes are released constantly, keeping the game fresh and modern. Even patches are released to limit certain cards that may seem too strong in the current version of the game. 


## Final Thoughts

I find this game to be very enjoyable, while also challenging as playing against different opponents with different decks keeps the tension throughout the battle. Yes, having costly cards or bad draws will always happen, and from this, losses can be predetermined, however that adds to the randomness of each individual game. Though many of the more modern cards seem too strong, that is how the game is evolving, so keeping up with game updates is crucial to winning especially in competitive play. Personally, I play more recreationally, so winning and losing come and go. What makes the experience enjoyable for me regardless of the outcome, is that the experience and fandom is shared between oneself and their opponent. Everyone plays because of their love for the game and the memories it brings.
